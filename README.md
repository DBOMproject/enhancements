# Enhancements
Public Tracking Repository for DEPs (DBoM Enhancement Proposals)

All enhancements are listed as [issues](https://github.com/DBOMproject/enhancements/issues) on this repository and follow a specific template. The labels on the issues indicate the state of the enhancement and discussions around the enhancements may occur on the issue or on other channels such as Slack/Email. All collaterals are expected to be linked to the master issue

Proposals are canonically referred to as "DEP-XYZ" where XYZ is the issue number associated with the enhancement proposal. Pull requests and issues that are created in the individual project repositories will use this canonical reference

# When to Create a New Enhancement Issue

Create an issue in this repository once you:

- have circulated your idea to see if there is interest
through our Slack Channels, Weekly technical touch-bases or mailing lists
- (optionally) have done a prototype in your own fork or have identified people who agree to work on the enhancement
